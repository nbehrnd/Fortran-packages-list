# Beliavsky et al. curate a list about GitHub hosted projects using Fortran.[1]
# Script xfpm.py processes these data to eventually write a new README.md about
# those projects which in addition manage their project with the Fortran package
# manager (fpm).  The manual update of the list is to be replaced by one running
# automatically -- a GitHub action appears to be an approach suitable.
